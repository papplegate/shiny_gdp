Code for Shiny app on https://papplegate.shinyapps.io/energy_co2_quality_of_life/

This app lets users explore relationships between energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, and quality of life among countries.  For example, energy use drives a higher standard of living, but people in some countries live longer than people in other countries where more energy is used.  There is a five-slide description of the app on RPubs (http://rpubs.com/patrick_applegate/energy_co2_quality_of_life); those slides are also part of this repository.
